# Agentic RAG System

This project implements a high-level, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The system integrates various technologies to support multi-step reasoning and hybrid search, including LangChain, LlamaIndex, FAISS, the Gemini API, and FastAPI.

## Features
- **Multi-step reasoning** with master and sub-agents to handle queries efficiently.
- **Hybrid search** combines semantic and keyword search for more accurate results.
- **Multimodal data ingestion** supports both text and PDFs for versatile data handling.
- **Memory module** to maintain contextual continuity in interactions.
- Scalable and **production-ready architecture**.

## Components
- **Main Script (`main.py`)**: Implements the core RAG system.
- **API (`api.py`)**: A FastAPI application to serve as a RESTful interface.
- **Requirements (`requirements.txt`)**: Lists all dependencies for the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourrepo/agentic-rag-system.git
   cd agentic-rag-system
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the environment variables. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the necessary configurations:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

### Running the System
To start the FastAPI server, run the following command:
```bash
uvicorn api:app --reload
```

#### Endpoints
- **POST `/ingest`**: Ingest text or PDF data into the system.
- **POST `/query`**: Submit a query to receive a response generated by the RAG system.
- **GET `/health`**: Check the system status and health.

### Docker Deployment
You can easily deploy the system using Docker:
```bash
docker build -t agentic-rag-system .
docker run -p 8000:8000 agentic-rag-system
```
